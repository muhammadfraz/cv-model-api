## **Features**
- Serve pre-trained models for **image classification** and **object detection**.
- Supports both **real-world** and **simulated datasets**.
- Extensible for additional computer vision tasks.
- Easy-to-deploy architecture using **Docker** and **cloud-ready tools**.
- Built-in **logging** and **error handling** for robust performance.
